[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) serialization library for various Smalltalk dialects.

Current supported dialects are:
  * Squeak
  * Pharo
  * VisualWorks
  * VA Smalltalk
  * Dolphin Smalltalk

(Still in Beta - GNU Smalltalk)

Please see HowToInstall, HowToUse.

Currently MessagePack-RPC is out of scope. We are focusing on serialization.

We are moving main repository to GitHub.
